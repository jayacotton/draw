# draw
Drawlines on a 4010 emulator with your z80


This code was converted from fortran to c.  Thus it is pass by address and not by reference.
I am it the process of 'c'iffing the code.  

DO NOT USE THIS YET.

WRT license.  I found the fortran source on bitsaver, there was no license there, email to
tektronix was not replied to.  I don't think they care about it anymore but, don't build a
project on this code base.
